Description:
    This project is a memory game created using JavaScript and HTML. It works
    by asking the players for their information and information about their
    game. It then appropriately sets up a memory game board based on the user
    inputs, and allows the users to compete and test their memory skills.

    I created a memory game similar to this using Java in CS335, so I was able
    to carry over a lot of the logic that I used in that into this project.

Questions:
    1. Javascript runs in the browser, so it doesn't need the server to process
        any information unlike the first project that used CGI.

    2. If somebody were to have the name of my file, they could theoretically
        go to my URL and see my source code.

    3. In regards to data structures, I simply just assigned each <td> element
        on the gameBoard to have a certain ID. This ID mimics the indexes
        of an array of "cards" that I created, where each element in the array
        has a color and number value randomly assigned to it. In this way, I
        was able to shuffle the array and randomly "place" cards on the board
        without having to mess with the <td> elements. I could access the color
        and number value of every <td> element by using it's ID and finding the
        index in my array that matched it.

    4. My program accepts mouse clicks on any element in the game board even
        after the first two cards have been selected and the game is waiting
        for the user to click the message to flip the cards back over. Although
        these clicks are registered, the cards do not flip over since they do
        not pass the "if" and "else if" statements. Clicking on already matched
        cards triggers as well, but no code is performed.
